  Command     | Status      |   Info
  ---         |  ---        |   ---
  **select**  | Working     | select client to interact with

## Current Features
### Architecture
- RPC (Remote procedure Call) based communication for easy addition of new functionallity
- Automatic upx leads to client binaries of ~6MB with embedded Tor
- sqlite via gorm for storing information about the clients
- client is obfuscated via [garble](https://github.com/burrowers/garble)
- Unique persistent ID for every client
	- give a client an Alias
	- all Downloads from client get saved to ./$ID/$filename

## Persistence
- Windows:
	- [ ] Multiple User Account Control Bypasses (Privilege escalation)
	- [ ] Multiple Persistence methods (User, Admin)

- Linux:
  - [ ] Multiple Persistence methods (User, Admin)

## Tor
- Fully embedded Tor within go

- the ToRAT_client communicates over TLS encrypted RPC proxied through Tor with the ToRat_server (hidden service)
	- [x] anonymity of client and server
	- [x] end-to-end encryption

- optional transport without Tor e.g. Use Tor2Web, a DNS Hostname or public/ local IP
	- [x] smaller binary ~7MB upx'ed
	- [ ] anonymity of client and server

## Server Shell
- Cross Platform reverse shell (Windows, Linux, Mac OS)
- Supports multiple connections
- Welcome Banner
- Colored Output
- Tab-Completion of:
  - Commands
  - Files/ Directories in the working directory of the server



## Upcoming Features
- [ ] Bulk Commands
- [ ] Privilege escalation for Linux
- [ ] Persistence and privilege escalation for Mac OS
- [ ] Support for Android and iOS needs fix of https://github.com/ipsn/go-libtor/issues/12
- [ ] [File-less Persistence on Windows](https://github.com/ewhitehats/InvisiblePersistence)
